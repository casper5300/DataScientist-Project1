## Summary
1. We selected the top 10 listings and did some investagation. 
2. The lowset price appeared at the begining of 2016. Maybe beacuase the Chrismas day. The price started to rise since Feb and reached the peak in the middle of year and last for roughly two months. Then back to the average level.
3. For some listings the price would rose on Fri and Sat and fell back on other days. Also, we found some hosts were lazy to change the price. They just used one price for whole year.
